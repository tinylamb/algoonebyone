    It will only work when the object being copied,
     as well as all of the other objects references directly or indirectly by the object,
     are serializable. (In other words, they must implement java.io.Serializable.)
     Fortunately it is often sufficient to simply declare that a given class implements java.io.Serializable and let Javaâ€™s default serialization mechanisms do their thing.
Java Object Serialization is slow, and using it to make a deep copy requires both serializing and deserializing. There are ways to speed it up (e.g., by pre-computing serial version ids and defining custom readObject() and writeObject() methods), but this will usually be the primary bottleneck.
The byte array stream implementations included in the java.io package are designed to be general enough to perform reasonable well for data of different sizes and to be safe to use in a multi-threaded environment. These characteristics, however, slow down ByteArrayOutputStream and (to a lesser extent) ByteArrayInputStream.
